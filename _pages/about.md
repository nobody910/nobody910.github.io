I am a PhD student in [Networked Systems Security (NSS) Group](https://nss.proj.kth.se/) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/), Sweden, supervised by [Prof. Panos Papadimitratos](https://people.kth.se/~papadim/). My KTH profile is [here](https://www.kth.se/profile/shengliu/). I am funded by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/), i.e., Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. 

I received my master's degree and my B.Eng. degree from the School of  Intelligent Systems Engineering, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), China, in 2024 and 2021, respectively. 

I'm always delighted to collaborate, discuss, chat, and learn from different minds! So please feel free to contact me via email (shengliu@kth.se), WeChat (nobody-910), or any other convenient means of communication!

My current **research interests** focus on the intersection between: 
* trustworthy AI (e.g., federated learning)
* intelligent transportation (e.g., autonomous driving)
* security and privacy (e.g., data poisoning attacks)
