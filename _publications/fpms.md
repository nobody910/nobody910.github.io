**Abstract**: Along with the trend towards an autonomous transportation system (ATS), the intelligence of personal mobility service (PMS) can be further lifted by sensing travelersâ€™ statuses comprehensively, learning behavior patterns accurately, providing travel options appropriately, and giving service responses timely. Such a process relies on a seamless information flow, which shall address data silos caused by laws and regulations about privacy. This paper proposes a federated architecture for PMS, called FPMS, which adopts federated learning, to provide personalized multi-modal options by aggregating personal data in a privacy-preserving way, and utilizing idle resources of personal devices within the service cluster. In general, by analyzing the physical objects involved, functions required, and data processed, a reference architecture of FPMS is designed to guide its construction in ATS effectively and efficiently. Moreover, a performance evaluation between FPMS and conventional centralized PMS is also presented to reveal the advantages of FPMS in saving service costs.
